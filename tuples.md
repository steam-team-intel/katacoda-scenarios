Tuples store data of any type, they are ordered and cannot be modified.

The following statement creates a tuple:

`example_tuple = ('numbers', 50, 'colors', 7)
print('Tuple elements: ', example_tuple)
print('First element: ', example_tuple[0])
`{{copy}}

The following statement calls an element of the tuple by its index:

`print('First element: ', example_tuple[0])
`{{copy}}

Try modifying the tuple and analyze the result obtained. 

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
