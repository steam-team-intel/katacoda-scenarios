## Design the code for a work schedule of a new moving company.

The company only works on Mondays or Fridays. Also, he does not work on trips of more than 10km in distance.

The variables that you must declare are day and distance. Next, write the logic that solves the moving company's work schedule and specifications.

If the requirements of the moving company are not met, you will have to print in the console "Sorry, we cannot assist you." Otherwise, you should print "Yes we can assist you."

Perform the tests using the following values.

`day = Wednesday`{{copy}}
`distance = 5`{{copy}}

`day = Monday`{{copy}}
`distance = 10`{{copy}}

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
