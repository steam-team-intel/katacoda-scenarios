Variables are names that have a type of value and a value associated with them, something like a reference.

We say that a variable (in general, any object in programming) has a meaningful name when it specifies its use or content.

In Python, you don't need to declare variables or specify their data type. Variables are created by assigning value to them.

**String type** 

```python
phrase = "Hello world!"
print(x)
```{{copy}}

**Int type** 

In the following example, x can be referenced to do a sum, without specifying its value explicitly:

```python
x = 2
print(x + 4)
```{{copy}}

**Float type** 
```python
pi = 3.1415
print(pi)
```{{copy}}

**Boolean type** 
```python
ILikeToLearn = True
print(ILikeToLearn)
```{{copy}}

Try assigning your own variable and check the type of value it contains using type()

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
