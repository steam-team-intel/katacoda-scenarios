Dictionaries are unordered collections of pairs of elements.

These pairs are made up of unique keys and elements associated with them.

In the following piece of code, a dictionary is created and its values checked:
`students_residence = {'Ingrid': 'Alajuela', 'Valery': 'San Jose','Luis': 'Puntarenas' }
print('Pairs in the dictionary: ', students_residence)
print('Students:', list(students_residence))
print('Luis comes from', students_residence['Luis'])
