A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.

## Execute a statement:

You must copy in your test file:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```{{copy}}

As you can see, the statements are, in essence, commands that are given to the Python console.

```python
print(2021)
```{{copy}}

These statements include a call to the "print ()" method, which outputs the input we pass to it.
Not all statements have an exit. For example, if you copy to your file:

```python
x = 5
```{{copy}}

You can see how the file runs correctly, but it doesn't show anything on the console.

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
