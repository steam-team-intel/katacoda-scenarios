The concept of data type is important in programming, since each type of data has a different functionality.

In Python several types of data of different categories are handled. The most basic and commonly used types are * int, float, string *, and * bool *.

However, there are many more, such as * complex, list, tuple, dict, set, bytes * ...

To check the type of data, just call the type () method. Try running the following lines.

```python
print(type(1))
```{{copy}}

```python
print(type(3.4))
```{{copy}}

```python
print(type('hello'))
```{{copy}}

```python
print(type(True))
```{{copy}}

In Python it is also possible to specify a data type if desired:

```python
phrase = str("Hello World!")
num = int(2021)
print(type(phrase),type(num))
```{{copy}}

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
