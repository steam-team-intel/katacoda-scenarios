Some important concepts regarding the code format are:

## Comments

In programming, there are flags to tell the interpreter whether to ignore a line or piece of code.

In Python, "#" is used for a single line, and "'' '" for blocks of code.

Comments are useful for testing isolated chunks of code, or for including clarifications and / or internal documentation.

Run the following code:

```python
print('I want this line to be executed')
#print('This line should not be executed')
'''prhase='This block should not be executed'
print(phrase)'''
```{{copy}}

## Indentaci√≥n

While code readability is always important, in Python it is particularly vital.

Indentation is the margin before starting a line, and denotes the hierarchy that the code must follow when executing.

In Python, badly indented code can potentially fail, even if the logic is correct.

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
