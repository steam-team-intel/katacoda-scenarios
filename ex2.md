Design a function that takes as input a word and returns as output the same word in reverse.

Input: Hello
Output: olleH

Input: Earth
Output: htraE

### Hint1: in Python lists can be traversed with a for loop.

### Hint2: Remember that the .insert () function can be used to add elements to a list.

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
