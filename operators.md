Operators are used to perform different operations between variables and values.

Some examples are:

**Assignment operators**
```python>
x=2
y=3
print("Original value of y:",y)
y=x
print("We assign x to y:",y)
```{{copy}}

**Arithmetic operators**
```python
x=2
y=3
print(x*y)
```{{copy}}

**Comparison operators**
```python
x=2
y=2
theyAreEqual = x==y #variable de tipo booleano
print(theyAreEqual)
```{{copy}}

**Logical operators**
```python
condition1 = True
condition2 = False
print(condition1 and condition1) 
print(condition1 or condition2) 
print(not condition2)
```{{copy}}

Write an expression using an operator with the numbers 3 and 6 that results in True.

***Reminder:*** To run from console, enter the command:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}
