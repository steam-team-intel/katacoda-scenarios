Buenos días, 

## ¡Bienvenidos al taller de Python de Iniciativas STEAM de Intel Costa Rica!

The first thing we will do is configure the environment and run Python.

For this workshop it is not necessary to install Python on your machine. To start it will only be necessary:

**1.** Go to the "IDE" tab. 

**2.** Under "ROOT" in the file explorer on the left, you will find an option to create a new file. Call the same "testfile.py".

**3.** In the icon menu on the left, select the first icon, and then Terminal> New Terminal from the drop-down menu.

***IMPORTANT:*** It will be necessary to repeat these steps in case the environment is disconnected and you have to refresh the tab.

**Running in Python**

Once these steps have been completed, we can run Python in the terminal. For this it is only necessary to write:

`python3`{{copy}}

You can see how, while it is running, Python gives you different options. For example, you can try typing "Credits".

If you want to exit the python console type:

`quit()`{{copy}}

**Running a file .py**

You can use the file "testfile.py" created earlier.

Try copying this into your file:

`print(1)`{{copy}}

To run the file, type the following command in terminal:

`python3 testfile.py`{{copy}}

***TIP:*** In this workshop we will run this file constantly. However, you do not need to type the command every time you need it.
You can press the up arrow on your keyboard to reuse previously used commands.
